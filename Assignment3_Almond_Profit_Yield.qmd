# Import the almond yield function
source("almond_yield_anomaly.R")
```

Develop a profit model for your almond yield

Use your imagination to think about what would make sense
Make sure you include parameters
You could assume a baseline profit and then adjust according to the anomaly

As of 2/04/25, California Almonds sell for $2.12 a pound according to the Melo Farming Group.
70% of almond farms in California are 100 acres or less according to the Almond Board of California.
According to Fruit Growers Supply, one acre of almond orchard produces 2400 lbs of almonds per year

Parameters
Current Price of Almonds in dollars: Set default value at $2.12
Size of Farm in acres: Set default value at 100 acres

Input
Almond Yield per Acre: Set default value at 2400 lbs of almonds per year (1.2 tons/acre)

Add almond yield anomaly function

Convert pounds to tons, 1 ton is 2000 lbs


```{r}
almond_profit <- function(almond_price = 4240, farm_acreage = 100, acre_yield = 1.2, filepath) {
  profit = almond_price * farm_acreage * (acre_yield + almond_yield_anomaly(filepath))
  return(profit)
}
```

```{r}
almond_profit(filepath = "data/clim.txt")
```
